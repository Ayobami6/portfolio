                    <p id="about-text">
                      My name is Alaran Ayobami Abdullateef, studied statistics
                      in college, Yaba college of technology, which is an higher
                      institution in lagos Nigeria. Graduated with second class
                      upper. I'm currently working as a Software engineer
                      trainee at holberton school of software engineering
                      powered by alx_africa group. While i was in school l'm
                      always refer to as the tech guy by my peers because
                      whenever they need to or want to do anything relating to
                      tech or their project data analysis they come to me and
                      when they come to me i don't always know what they want me
                      to do or how to do it, all I know is that i'm confident
                      that i know how to know what they want me to do so I
                      accept to do it for them. Moreso, I've always think of
                      myself as an artist, because everything I do is artistic,
                      I think creatively and innovatively to solve problems
                      leveraging technology. Hence, to me thats a great art. I
                      believe my passion for my art makes me do better and want
                      to do better, because there is no great art without
                      passion. My passion alongside my artistic trait is what I
                      consistently put to what i do, which is basically tech and
                      I'm mostly interested in Software Engineering, Data
                      Science and Machine Learning. Aside tech, I love rap and
                      movies, I mean they are artistic and poetic and the
                      craftmen are something else, I would know because I'm a
                      super fan of Jay Z, his raps inpires and motivates me. Of
                      all my skills, the most important ones are my problem
                      solving skill which I put to my work and will keep
                      improving and my ability of knowing how to know things. I
                      don't always know things or most things, but what I do
                      always know is how to know those things.
